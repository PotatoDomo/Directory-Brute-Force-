# Directory-Brute-Force-
A brute force directory tool coded in Java

# How It Works

The tool takes a base URL and a .txt file as inputs. It appends each word in the .txt to the base URL and makes an HTTP GET request to check if the resulting URL exists. If the HTTP status code is not 404 (Not Found), it prints the URL and the status code.

# How to use it 

java Brut `<URL>` `<.txt file>`
